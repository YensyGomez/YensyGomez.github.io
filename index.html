        <p>
          Known for his dazzling charm, rapier wit, and unrivaled humility,
          Michael is the creator of the
          <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails
          Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
          <a href="https://learnenough.com/">
          Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a> introductory sequence. Michael
          is also notorious as the founder of
          <a href="http://tauday.com/">Tau Day</a> and author of
          <a href="http://tauday.com/tau-manifesto"><em>The Tau
          Manifesto</em></a>, but rumors that he's secretly a supervillain
          are slightly exaggerated.

          When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes on
          his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
          interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
          interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

        <p>
          You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
          Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd at
          heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a tour
          bus as he is from his kitchen table.
